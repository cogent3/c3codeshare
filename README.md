# Community contributions for cogent3 and related projects

If you have used a cogent3 ecosystem project solve a problem and would like to share your solution, then you're in the right place!

To make a contribution, [create a new issue](https://github.com/cogent3/c3community/issues/new/choose), select "Code Contribution" and complete the form. Your code will be vetted and styled. If it passes, your issue will automatically be closed and an entry added to this README 🎉. If it does not use one of the projects listed, has syntax errors, or exceeds 100 lines of code, then the issue will be automatically labeled as invalid and remain open for you to fix.

> Only submit your own work!

Select "Blank issue" if:

- you see a code contribution that you think is suspicious
- you think your project should be included on the allowed list
- you think we need to change the sections in this file
