# Community contributions for cogent3 and related projects

To make a contribution, [create a new issue](https://github.com/cogent3/c3community/issues/new/choose), select "Code Contribution" and complete the form. Your code will be vetted and styled. If it passes, your issue will automatically be closed and an entry added to this README 🎉. If it does not use one of the projects listed, has syntax errors, or exceeds 100 lines of code, then the issue will be automatically labeled as invalid and remain open for you to fix.

Select "Blank issue" if:

- you see any code contributions that you think are suspicious
- you think your project should be included on that list
- you think we need to change the sections in this file
